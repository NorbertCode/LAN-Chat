# LAN-Chat
A simple messaging program that works over LAN. 

You may need to allow port 9999 through your firewall to make it work. The GUI version (main.py) requires Tkinter.

I highly recommend using the GUI version instead of the CLI. It has more functionality and a lot better user experience. To disconnect in the cli version just kill the process, for example using `CTRL+C`.
